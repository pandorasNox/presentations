Note:

### What?

- **culture** is key

- **autonomy** is key

<!-- ========== ========== ========== -->

### At our company

- we are on a pretty good track
- we got an ops team
- we got ops knowledge in every team
- we got **automation**

### tasks for the  platform team?

- we are in favor of engaging

- abstract the hard ops tasks
- boost knowledge sharing

<br />
and more

<!-- ========== ========== ========== -->

### What can you do?

Culture it's not about
- one person
- it's not about me
- it's not about one team

<!-- ========== ========== ========== -->

### What can you do?

Culture is about:
- everyone
- our company
- your brilliant ideas
- our interaction
- everything we do together
